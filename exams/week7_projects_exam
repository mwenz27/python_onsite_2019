HEROKU DEPLOYMENT / SWITCHING DJANGO'S DB BACKEND
=================================================

1) High level steps to get our project up and running on Heroku

install heroku command app - its a program which runs on bash

Step 1. Create a Procfile in your project root.

Procfile

web: gunicorn project_name.wsgi


pip install apps
# login to your heroku
heroku login
# create new app if one doesn't yet exist
heroku create

# create a new postgres database for your app

# migrate your database to the heroku app



add data commands app/settings.py

import django_heroku
django_heroku.settings(locals())


2) What do we need to prepend to a python command in order to
run code remotely on a Heroku server?

hero run


3) What does a database connection string consist of?

DATABASES = {
    "default": {
        "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2",
        "NAME": "learninglogs_db",
        "USER": "Wenz",
        "PASSWORD": "",
        "HOST": "localhost",
        "PORT": "5432",
    }
}
When your application connects to a database or a data file you let ADO or ADO.Net
utilize a provider to do the job for you. The connection string contains the information
that the provider need to know to be able to establish a connection to the database or the
data file.

4) Where do the parts of Q3 go in Django?

settings.py


5) High level steps to migrate a DB from SQLite to Postgres

Dump existing data:

python3 manage.py dumpdata > datadump.json
Change settings.py to Postgres backend.

Make sure you can connect on PostgreSQL. Then:

python3 manage.py migrate --run-syncdb
Run this on Django shell to exclude contentype data

python3 manage.py shell
>>> from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType
>>> ContentType.objects.all().delete()
>>> quit()
Finally:



run heroku  python3 manage.py loaddata datadump.json



YOUR QUESTIONS

3) BLAKE: Working with different branches and pushing to Heroku, how can we guarantee uptime?


run heroku git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]


5) MING: After changing data ownership permissions, what steps you need to follow to make
	that reflected in your app?




7) ROBERT:
	* How to use static files (CSS, JS) with Django on a server?
	* How to push your database information up to a remote DB on Heroku?


STATIC_URL = '/static/'
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')

MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = BASE_DIR
